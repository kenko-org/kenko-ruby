# Kenko

Zero dependency library for adding [health checks](https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/health-check-api.html) to any rack based projects.

Supported features:

1. custom health endpoint;
2. html/json pages by defauld;
3. custom checks;
4. specify checks for the each middleware;

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kenko'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kenko

## Motivation

[Health checks](https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/health-check-api.html) important thing for k8s and for understanding the current status of the server. Usually, ruby libraries have problems:

1. Specific checks for the framework (only rails usually);
2. Hard to add custom checks for project-specific logic (service communications or specific DB checks);
3. Default rack check just checks nothing;

That's why this library was born. It's a default core framework for creating health checks for specific libraries or frameworks like hanami, rails, siquel, mongoid, etc,

## Usage

### Base

Step 1: define custom checks

```ruby
require 'kenko'

Kenko::Container.register(:base) { :ok }
Kenko::Container.register(:database) { SQLConnection.execute }
Kenko::Container.register(:redis) { Redis.ping }
```

Step 2: add middleware

```ruby
require 'sinatra/base'
require 'kenko/middleware'

class Web < Sinatra::Base
  use Kenko::Middleware, checks: :all, path: '/health'

  get '/' do
    'index'
  end
end
```

Step 3: open `/health` or `/health.json` and see result

### How to add custom checks
Just register a new check before start rack server:

```ruby
Kenko::Container.register(:good) { :ok }
Kenko::Container.register(:bad) { nil }
Kenko::Container.register(:servie) { Service.get(:ping).success? }
```
